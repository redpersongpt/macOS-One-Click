OpCore-OneClick is a desktop app that helps you prepare an OpenCore-based macOS installer on supported PC hardware.

It scans the machine, checks the hardware path, builds the EFI, downloads recovery files when needed, and prepares the target drive without skipping the parts that still need user review.

## What It Does

- Hardware scan for CPU, GPU, chipset, storage, and peripherals
- Compatibility validation before EFI generation or deployment
- OpenCore EFI build for the detected hardware path
- macOS recovery download from Apple infrastructure where applicable
- USB or partition deployment with resumable downloads

## Workflow

1. Scan the machine and identify the real hardware path.
2. Validate display, SMBIOS, and EFI constraints before write.
3. Build the OpenCore configuration and supporting files.
4. Fetch the required recovery and dependency assets.
5. Deploy to a USB drive or boot partition.

## Safety Checks

- Blocks unsupported GPU and display paths early
- Verifies EFI layout and configuration consistency before deployment
- Keeps recovery downloads resumable across restarts when the saved session is still valid
- Leaves BIOS changes and final install decisions under user review

## Platform Support

- Available on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Built for preparing OpenCore-based macOS install media on supported PC hardware
- Some paths still depend on your hardware, network adapter, and chosen macOS version
