    shortLabel: 'System drive — cannot flash',
    explanation:
      'This drive appears to be your main system disk (the one your operating system is installed on). Flashing this drive would erase your OS and all your data.',
    howToFix:
      'Select a removable USB drive instead. If no USB drives appear in the list, insert a USB drive of 16 GB or larger and click Refresh.',
  },
  MBR_PARTITION_TABLE: {
    shortLabel: 'MBR partition table — must convert',
    explanation:
      'This drive uses an MBR (Master Boot Record) partition table. OpenCore requires a GPT (GUID Partition Table) structure to boot successfully.',
    howToFix:
      'Convert the disk to GPT using your system\'s disk utility (this will erase all data), then retry. Or select a different drive.',
  },
  UNKNOWN_PARTITION_TABLE: {
    shortLabel: 'Cannot read partition table',
    explanation:
      "The drive's partition structure could not be read. This can happen with brand-new drives, drives formatted with an unusual scheme, or drives that are faulty.",

      'Reconnect the drive and click Refresh. If the problem persists, reformat the drive as GPT using Disk Utility (macOS), GParted (Linux), or diskpart (Windows), then try again.',

  NO_ADMIN: {
    shortLabel: 'Privilege elevation required',
    explanation:
      'Writing to disks requires elevated access. The app does not currently have the necessary permissions.',
    howToFix:
      'On Windows, right-click the application and choose "Run as administrator". On Linux, install polkit (sudo apt install policykit-1) — the app will prompt for your password per operation. Do not run the whole app as root.',
  },
  FIRMWARE_UNVERIFIED: {
    shortLabel: 'BIOS settings unverified',
    explanation:
      'One or more BIOS/UEFI settings could not be automatically detected. The app cannot confirm these settings are correct without firmware-level access.',
    howToFix:
      "Check each listed setting manually in your target PC's BIOS/UEFI firmware. Restart the target PC, press Del, F2, or F12 during POST to enter BIOS, and verify each setting listed on the BIOS Setup screen.",

  NETWORK_UNAVAILABLE: {
    shortLabel: 'No internet connection',
    explanation:
      'No internet connection was detected. The macOS recovery files must be downloaded from Apple servers and cannot be packaged with the app.',

  },
  UNSUPPORTED_HOST: {
    shortLabel: 'Host OS not fully supported',

      'This host operating system is not in the fully tested configuration. Some hardware detection or disk operations may not work correctly.',

      "Your system is running in compatibility mode due to a detected hardware or driver issue. Some hardware detection features may be limited.",

  DOWNLOAD_FAILED: {
    shortLabel: 'Download interrupted',
    explanation:
      'The macOS recovery download was interrupted. This is often caused by a lost network connection or a temporary server error.',
    howToFix:
      'Click Retry — the download will resume from where it left off if the partial file is still present. If retry fails repeatedly, check your internet connection.',
  },
  DISK_WRITE_FAILED: {
    shortLabel: 'USB write failed',
    explanation:
      'Writing to the USB drive failed part-way through. This may indicate a faulty drive, a write-protected drive, or a permission problem.',
    howToFix:
      'Try a different USB drive. Make sure the drive is not write-protected (check for a physical lock switch). On Windows, re-run as Administrator.',
  },
  NOT_REMOVABLE: {
    shortLabel: 'Internal drive — cannot flash',
    explanation:
      'This drive is identified as an internal drive, not a removable USB device. Only external USB drives are allowed for flashing.',
    howToFix:
      'Use a removable USB drive of 16 GB or larger. Insert one and click Refresh to see it in the list.',
  },
  DEVICE_TOO_SMALL: {
    shortLabel: 'Drive too small (need ≥ 16 GB)',
    explanation:
      'The macOS recovery image and OpenCore EFI require at least 16 GB of space on the USB drive.',
    howToFix: 'Use a USB drive with at least 16 GB of storage.',
  },
  LOW_DISK_SPACE: {
    shortLabel: 'Low free space on this machine',
    explanation:
      'The recovery download and EFI build require significant free space on the host machine (where this app is running), separate from the USB drive.',
    howToFix:
      'Free up at least 8 GB of space on your main drive. Delete temporary files, empty the trash, or move large files to external storage.',
  },
  MISSING_BINARY: {
    shortLabel: 'Required tool not found',
    explanation:
      'A required system utility is missing. The app uses platform tools like diskutil, diskpart, and dd for safe disk operations.',
    howToFix:
      'On macOS, these tools are built in. On Linux, install parted and dosfstools (sudo apt install parted dosfstools). On Windows, diskpart is built into the OS.',
  },
  FIRMWARE_FAILING: {
    shortLabel: 'BIOS setting needs to be changed',
    explanation:
      'A required BIOS/UEFI setting is currently set to a value that will prevent macOS from booting. This must be fixed before continuing.',
    howToFix:
      "Reboot into your target PC's BIOS. The required change and where to find it are shown on the BIOS Setup screen. Save and exit BIOS, then return here.",
  },
  NO_USB_DETECTED: {
    shortLabel: 'No USB drives detected',
    explanation:
      'No removable USB drives were found. The app only lists drives that are confirmed removable to reduce the risk of flashing the wrong device.',

      'Plug in a USB drive of 16 GB or larger and click Refresh. If the drive still does not appear, try a different USB port.',
  },
  SCAN_TIMEOUT: {

    explanation:
      'The hardware scan did not complete within the expected time. This can happen on machines with many peripherals or slow system queries.',
    howToFix:
      'Click Retry to scan again. If the problem persists, check that system management tools (WMI on Windows, lshw on Linux) are functioning.',
  },
  PRECHECK_TIMEOUT: {
    shortLabel: 'System check timed out',
    explanation:
      'The system check did not complete within the expected time. One or more checks did not return a result.',
